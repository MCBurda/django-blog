# A blog application built with Django

This blog was built as part of a tutorial by Corey Schafer. I customised some parts of the code. 

To try out the blog, you will need to install the required Python packages in: requirements.txt

I also did not push my SQLite database, which you will need to add as a file to the project or regenerate based off the standard django DB and python migration scripts outlined in the project.
